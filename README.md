# Python Testing with Hypothesis, Coverage, and MutMut

This project demonstrates the use of Python testing tools such as `unittest`, `hypothesis`, `coverage`, and `mutmut` for creating robust and reliable applications. Follow the steps below to set up and execute tests.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Python testing frameworks.

---

## Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment helps isolate dependencies.

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment to start working.

On Linux/Mac:
bash
Copy code
source venv/bin/activate
On Windows:
cmd
Copy code
venv\Scripts\activate
Installation
Install required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install hypothesis
Running Tests
Running Unit Tests
Discover and run all tests in the project using unittest.

bash
Copy code
python3 -m unittest discover
Measuring Test Coverage
Run tests with coverage to measure code coverage.

bash
Copy code
coverage run -m unittest discover
Generate an HTML report:

bash
Copy code
coverage html
Open htmlcov/index.html in a browser to view the coverage report.

Mutation Testing with MutMut
MutMut tests the quality of your unit tests by introducing small code changes (mutations) and checking if the tests catch them.

Running MutMut
Start the mutation testing process:

bash
Copy code
mutmut run
Viewing Results
View a summary of the results:

bash
Copy code
mutmut results
Check detailed results for a specific file:

bash
Copy code
mutmut show <result_file_name>
View all mutation results:

bash
Copy code
mutmut results --all true
