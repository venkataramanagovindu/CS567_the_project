# Python Testing with Hypothesis, Coverage, and MutMut

This project demonstrates the use of Python testing tools such as `unittest`, `hypothesis`, `coverage`, and `mutmut` for creating robust and reliable applications. Follow the steps below to set up and execute tests.

---

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Familiarity with Python testing frameworks.

---

## Setup

### Create a Virtual Environment
A virtual environment helps isolate dependencies.

```
python3 -m venv venv

```
Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the environment to start working.

```
On Linux/Mac:

```
source venv/bin/activate

```

On Windows:
cmd

venv\Scripts\activate
Installation
Install required dependencies:



pip install hypothesis
Running Tests
Running Unit Tests
Discover and run all tests in the project using unittest.



python3 -m unittest discover
Measuring Test Coverage
Run tests with coverage to measure code coverage.



coverage run -m unittest discover
Generate an HTML report:



coverage html
Open htmlcov/index.html in a browser to view the coverage report.

Mutation Testing with MutMut
MutMut tests the quality of your unit tests by introducing small code changes (mutations) and checking if the tests catch them.

Running MutMut
Start the mutation testing process:



mutmut run
Viewing Results
View a summary of the results:



mutmut results
Check detailed results for a specific file:



mutmut show <result_file_name>
View all mutation results:



mutmut results --all true
